# PingMyRide - Firebase Authentication Setup

## Role-Based Authentication System

This application now uses Firebase Authentication with Cloud Firestore for role-based user management.

### User Roles

1. **Admin** - Full system access and management capabilities
2. **Driver** - Bus operations and route management
3. **Student** - Booking and tracking services

### Database Structure

The application uses Cloud Firestore with the following structure:

```
/users/{userId}
â”œâ”€â”€ uid: string
â”œâ”€â”€ email: string
â”œâ”€â”€ username: string
â”œâ”€â”€ role: "admin" | "driver" | "student"
â”œâ”€â”€ createdAt: timestamp
â””â”€â”€ isActive: boolean
```

### Available Test Accounts

The app automatically creates the following test accounts for easy testing:

#### ðŸ”‘ **Primary Test Accounts**
| Role | Email | Password | Username |
|------|-------|----------|----------|
| Admin | admin@test.com | admin123 | Test Admin |

### Admin Features

**Account Management:**
- **Create Account**: Add new users with any role
- **View Accounts**: See all registered users with filtering options
- Access through Admin dashboard after login

### Authentication Flow

1. User selects their role (Admin/Driver/Student)
2. System shows role-specific login screen with test credentials
3. User can tap test credentials to auto-fill or enter manually
4. System validates credentials AND role match
5. If role doesn't match: Clear error message + automatic logout
6. If successful: Role-based navigation to appropriate dashboard

### Error Handling

- **Role Mismatch**: "Role mismatch: This account is registered as [Role], but you tried to login as [Role]"
- **Invalid Credentials**: "Login failed. Please check your credentials."
- **Registration Issues**: "Registration failed. Email may already be in use."
